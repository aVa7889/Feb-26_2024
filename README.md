Prof. Klaus Schwab is the executive chairman of the organization.  After completing his education, he developed a passion for creating a platform to facilitate interaction and collaboration between business leaders, governments, and societies to improve the world.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) is primarily funded by over 1,000 member companies contributing annually. In addition to this, they also receive sponsorships, subsidies, and donations from governments, as well as private and public sectors that support their various projects and initiatives.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) is dedicated to addressing global issues, and in this case study, the focus is on climate change.

One unique aspect of this organization is its platform that brings together various national governments, leading companies, and major organizations. The goal is to discuss and find a path forward to solve global climate issues. This organization's only competition is from those who do not believe in science and refuse to try to create a better world for the next generation.
This organization is taking the lead in the fight against climate change. However, they do not have their technology. Instead, their membership companies are working towards supporting their mission. Most global companies have made efforts to tackle climate change, but there are also start-up companies that focus on related issues.

AI technology has the potential to predict the weather accurately by analyzing data on weather patterns, icebergs, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and other environmental factors. This analysis can help inform policies and regulations aimed at reducing emissions and mitigating the impact of climate change.  The major improvement needed is finding ways to emit less and waste fewer natural resources to make the earth more sustainable. The major trend in this field is a warmer atmosphere, a warmer and more acidic ocean, higher sea levels, and dramatic changes in weather patterns.

One example is **Circulor** a platform that tracks raw materials from their source to final products, helping manufacturers and suppliers make their processes more sustainable. [Circulor](https://www.circulor.com/gated-content/how-circulor's-scale-and-market-leading-solutions-bring-a-network-effect-to-our-customers-)
The Circulor platform utilizes PROVE to digitally present the physical journey of materials from their origin to the final product. PROVE comprises six modules: Supply Chain Mapping, Material Traceability, Emissions Tracking, Compliance, Sustainability, and Digital Product Passports. 
Circulor's solutions are built on a private enterprise SaaS platform. This technology has been designed to enable seamless data integration from existing enterprise platforms to the blockchain, using RESTful web service APIs with advanced security and authentication protocols. The company's performance was measured as follows: 
${\color{red}Reliability}$

According to a 2021 analysis by WEF, eight industries, including automotive, construction, and consumer electronics, are responsible for over 50% of global CO2 emissions concentrated in supply chains. 

    - 125+ facilities actively providing data to the platform
    - 52% of global cell manufacturers by production volume providing data for more than 3 years
    - 150 million battery cells/modules with a supply chain visibility
    - >500,000 vehicles on the road with traceability by Circulor
    - 2.1 billion traceability data collected.

Circulor is a UK green supply chain startup that has several goals:
Net-zero CO2e goal: Circulor's goal is to achieve a net-zero CO2e goal by 2050.
EV sales target: Circulor aims to have a 50% EV sales target by 2030.
Materials traceability: Circulor's goals include enabling traceability and compliance processes for companies that need to meet global regulations.
Data integrity: Circulor's goals include guaranteeing data integrity from mining raw critical minerals to the end of battery life.
Supply chain solution: Circulor helps OEMs achieve global climate-neutral manufacturing and operations goals. 

Another example is **Greyparrot**, an AI-powered waste recognition software that uses computer vision to monitor, audit, and sort waste on a large scale.
Greyparrot utilizes AI computer vision systems (cameras) to monitor and sort through large waste flows in resource recovery facilities. These systems capture real-time images of waste flows and use unique AI algorithms to identify characteristics such as mass, brand, and more with an accuracy of 95% or more, which is as precise as a human sorter. [Greyparrot](https://www.greyparrot.ai/)
The Greyparrot was founded in Feb 2019; the prototype analyzer was deployed in a South Korean recovery facility in April 2019.  The company gets funding from private investors and grants.  The first commercial unit was deployed in Jan 2021.  So far, they have identified over 25B waste objects each year.  There are now more than 100 Greyparrot analyzer units across 14+ countries.  In 2023, the Greyparrot helped customers return nearly 70,000 tons of waste into the circular economy.   The Greyparrot mission is to enhance recycling efficiency and minimize the environmental impact of waste.  Working with industry leaders like Veolia and Suez, Greyparrot is already adopted by 60 percent of the European market to reduce costs and increase profitability.  

The other example is **Aclima**, based in San Francisco, CA, an AI software solution designed to visualize crucial air quality data that could help protect public health.[Aclima](https://www.aclima.io/)
The Aclima company employs sensor networks, cloud computing, and AI to provide hyperlocal air quality data in real-time, much like Google's street view cars. It deploys sensor networks, cloud computing, and AI to provide hyperlocal air quality data in real-time using technology similar to that used by Google Street View cars.

The Aclima has accomplished the following:
```ruby
        Oakland, CA - complete
        Houston, TX - Data analysis complete; project in     
                    progress
        London, UK - Data collected; project in progress
```
Aclima has been deployed across the USA and worldwide, including New York, Washington DC, San Francisco Bay Area, Dublin, Ireland, and Hamburg, Germany.
The mission is for local environmental justice groups to use our findings to advocate for safeguards to clear the air and foster healthier communities.
